# Welcome

This project provides an HTTP backend for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), to save the state data in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

As the state is a JSON content, it just makes sense to use the best-in-class technology to store it!

## Key features

1. Highly available, performant, no vendor lock-in, storage system
2. Secured access to sensitive information, with tenant isolation
3. Integrate real data in your infrastructure management system
